## Overview
Syriatel Mobile Telecom is a service pervider that currently serves more than 8 million people today having 199 international roaming partners in 116 countries..  As an data scientist at this company, I am tasked with creating a model to predict when customers will stop doing business with us.  By building a model to help predict when customers will deter away from our service we can either offer additional resources to make the customer happier and improve our services that may be not opitimal.  This is a great way to improve our business. 


## Business Problem
Service providers strive to maintain a healthy balance between gaining new customers while minimizing those who switch providers.
